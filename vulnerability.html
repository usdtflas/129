  <h1>Vulnerability Disclosure Policy</h1>
</header>

<main>
  <h2>Systems in Scope</h2>
  <p>This policy applies to any digital assets owned, operated, or maintained by Bake.</p>

  <h2>Out of Scope</h2>
  <p>Assets or other equipment not owned by parties participating in this policy. Vulnerabilities discovered or suspected in out-of-scope systems should be reported to the appropriate vendor or applicable authority.</p>

  <h2>Our Commitments</h2>
  <p>When working with us, according to this policy, you can expect us to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Respond to your report promptly, and work with you to understand and validate your report.</li>
    <li>Strive to keep you informed about the progress of a vulnerability as it is processed.</li>
    <li>Work to remediate discovered vulnerabilities in a timely manner, within our operational constraints.</li>
    <li>Extend Safe Harbor for your vulnerability research that is related to this policy.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Our Expectations</h2>
  <p>In participating in our vulnerability disclosure program in good faith, we ask that you:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Play by the rules, including following this policy and any other relevant agreements. If there is any inconsistency between this policy and any other applicable terms, the terms of this policy will prevail.</li>
    <li>Report any vulnerability you’ve discovered promptly.</li>
    <li>Avoid violating the privacy of others, disrupting our systems, destroying data, and/or harming user experience.</li>
    <li>Use only the Official Channels to discuss vulnerability information with us.</li>
    <li>Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before you disclose it publicly.</li>
    <li>Perform testing only on in-scope systems, and respect systems and activities which are out of scope.</li>
    <li>If a vulnerability provides unintended access to data: 
      <ul>
        <li>Limit the amount of data you access to the minimum required for effectively demonstrating a Proof of Concept.</li>
        <li>Cease testing and submit a report immediately if you encounter any user data during testing, such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII), Personal Healthcare Information (PHI), credit card data, or proprietary information.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>You should only interact with test accounts you own or with explicit permission from the account holder.</li>
    <li>Do not engage in extortion.</li>
  </ul>
